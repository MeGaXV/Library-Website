        <li>Following Kaguya's defeat, the Sage of Six Paths has to return to the afterlife, taking the reanimated heroes of the past with him. To free the world from the Infinite Tsukuyomi's hold, Naruto must combine his tailed beast chakra with Sasuke's Rinnegan and weave the Sign of the Rat. Unfortunately, the near-end-of-the-world only hardened Sasuke's heart and substantiates his belief that he needs to rebuild ninja society from the ground up. Threatening to kill the Five Kage and Naruto before he'll let the people reawaken, Sasuke is dead-set on settling the score with his eternal frenemy once and for all. Nevertheless, Naruto continues to believe that there's some good in Sasuke, and he's determined to draw it out.</li>
